Getting Started:


Below is the tutorial to set up the repository:
https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/fork.html

Below this is the link to the repo itself:

https://github.com/ryanmurf9/CS205


There could be an error in adding the repository and the way to deal with that is adding your ssh key to your account on GitHub
1. Click your account for the dropdown in the top righthand corner of the screen
2. Choose settings
3. Click on SSH and GPG keys
4. Click on new SSH key and follow the instructions

Go to QT and open project and choose the repository then choose PROJECT CODE then choose UIDesign2 then open up the UIDesign2.pro file

Once the project is built run the main.cpp file in the folder UIDesign2

The login screen should pop up

Using the Program:


Update April 10:
The login is currently a work in progress with connecting to the database, but for now you can login using the username and password:: test

Failed password does not grant access

The signup page pops up when clicked and takes in data, but the access is not connected between the database and the login

Once in the program, there is a template for the museum main page which is not completed

The account button works, and you are not able to display the data yet for the user, but the edit button displays the page for changing the data

The home button works to take back to main, so the account pages and home pages are fully connected

We are working to complete the rest of the pages and their connections, and they should be completed in the next 2 days(by Sunday, April 12th)
