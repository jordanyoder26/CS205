Getting Started:


Below is the tutorial to set up the repository:
https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/fork.html

Below this is the link to the repo itself:

There could be an error in adding the repository and the way to deal with that is adding your ssh key to your account on GitHub
1. Click your account for the dropdown in the top righthand corner of the screen
2. Choose settings
3. Click on SSH and GPG keys
4. Click on new SSH key and follow the instructions

Go to QT and open project and choose the repository then choose PROJECT CODE then choose UIDesign2 then open up the UIDesign2.pro file

Once the project is built run the main.cpp file in the folder UIDesign2

The login screen should pop up

Exit the project and go to the build folder for your project

Once you are able to access your build folder, you should see where the database is set up called dbv2.sqlite
You need to delete this file and replace it with the dbv2 file found in the project folder

once you do this you are ready to start the program again from the main.cpp file

Once main.cpp is run, the program will be fully functional and you are able to operate the system.
